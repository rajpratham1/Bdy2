        <h1>Our Journey of Felt Moments</h1>

        <div class="felt-moments-text">
            <p>
                From the quiet mornings where we just exist in comfortable silence, to the wild, laughing adventures that define our weekends, every moment with you is a treasure. You’ve taught me that true love isn't just a grand gesture, but the million tiny feelings that build a life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember the first time I felt completely seen by you, the way you looked at me and understood everything without a single word. That feeling of connection, of belonging—it’s what I cherish most. Every time we overcome a challenge, every time we share a dream, my love for you deepens. You are my home, my anchor, and my most beautiful feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for filling my world with such profound love and happiness. These moments, these feelings, are the foundation of our beautiful life together.
